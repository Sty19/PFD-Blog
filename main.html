            <p>During the first week of our PFD class, our groups were drawn after being blndly picked by my fellow classmates. We had all answered a questionnaire regarding 
                our strengths and weaknesses prior to the selection, when the chosen leaders were selecting their group members, all of our names had been hidden to create parity.

            <p>On the second week of our PFD class, my team and I ideated around, trying to decide on the type of technology we would be using in order to 
                solve the problem statement that had been presented to us. We had settled on the idea of using RFID tags, along with bluetooth technology, to 
                track employees attendances automatically without much intraction having to be done by the user. Although the idea is still raw, we had been 
                on it together through the coming days to iron out any flaws that may have been present with the idea.
