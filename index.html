            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2023-10-30">October 30, 2023</time> by <a href="#">Shawn Tey</a></p>
            <p>During the first week of our PFD class, our groups were drawn after being blndly picked by my fellow classmates. We had all answered a questionnaire regarding 
                our strengths and weaknesses prior to the selection, when the chosen leaders were selecting their group members, all of our names had been hidden to create parity.

            <p>On the second week of our PFD class, my team and I ideated around, trying to decide on the type of technology we would be using in order to 
                solve the problem statement that had been presented to us. We had settled on the idea of using RFID tags, along with bluetooth technology, to 
                track employees attendances automatically without much intraction having to be done by the user. Although the idea is still raw, we had been 
                on it together through the coming days to iron out any flaws that may have been present with the idea.

            <p>For the third week of PFD class, we continued to make progress on each team members roles and responsibilities for the project, allowing us to 
                carry out the work we needed to do more effectively. We had also spent time trying and testing out our Arduino board, still grasping how we could
                utilise it for our project. Overall there was good progress made during this week and the outlook for our work is looking good.

            <p>For the fourth week of PFD, we dabbled heavily in the engineering side of our project, even with the help of Mr Ben, we struggled to undersatnd the 
                requirments neccessary for our little Arduino board to function as intended, leading to multiple failed attempts to fix all the issues that appeared.
                Luckily for us, our persistence did lead to a solution by the end of the lesson time, giving us hope to build on it for the hackathon next week. 
                Personally, I did my research on the software required to 3D model a gantry, one of the things we are hoping to showcase next week along with 
                our little gadget. After much frustration trying to use AutoCAD, we compomised and will betrying to build a successful example of what the gantry 
                may look like using cardboard.

            <h2>Week Five (Bytehackz Hackathon), Nov 15-17 2023</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2023-11-17">November 7, 2023</time> by <a href="#">Shawn Tey</a></p>
            <p>During the 2.5 day long hackathon on whitespace week, our team worked on further developing the Arduino system, as well as working towards the creation
                of a database to store the data related to the employees using our system. Over the course of the 2 days, the group made serious progress on the Arduino
                bot, being able to fix any pressing issues they had, as well as implementing a buzzer and a LED light system to aid in indicating users who pass through the
                system. The services available to us during the hackathon was very much helpful, with frequent trips to the genius bar helping the team solve the issues they
                faced when working on the bot.

            <h2>Week Thirteen, January 8 2024</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-01-08">January 8, 2024</time> by <a href="#">Shawn Tey</a></p>
            <p> For the first lesson back in the classroom since the Bytehackz hackathon, my team had the opoprtunity to get together once again to discuss the requirments
                given to us for Assignment 2. It was certainly an unusual feeling seeing our work once again, having been two months since we had last worked on it in class.
                However, after the cobwebs had been dusted off, we began work ideating on how we could substantially improve our prototype, and had come to the conclusion that
                we needed to pair it up with a mobile app, to obtain the full functionality of the prototype. We had then sorted out the responsobilities of each member and
                had begun working on the app and database to pair along with it.
