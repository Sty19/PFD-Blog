            <p>During the first week of our PFD class, our groups were drawn after being blndly picked by my fellow classmates. We had all answered a questionnaire regarding 
                our strengths and weaknesses prior to the selection, when the chosen leaders were selecting their group members, all of our names had been hidden to create parity.

            <p>On the second week of our PFD class, my team and I ideated around, trying to decide on the type of technology we would be using in order to 
                solve the problem statement that had been presented to us. We had settled on the idea of using RFID tags, along with bluetooth technology, to 
                track employees attendances automatically without much intraction having to be done by the user. Although the idea is still raw, we had been 
                on it together through the coming days to iron out any flaws that may have been present with the idea.

            <p>For the third week of PFD class, we continued to make progress on each team members roles and responsibilities for the project, allowing us to 
                carry out the work we needed to do more effectively. We had also spent time trying and testing out our Arduino board, still grasping how we could
                utilise it for our project. Overall there was good progress made during this week and the outlook for our work is looking good.

            <p>For the fourth week of PFD, we dabbled heavily in the engineering side of our project, even with the help of Mr Ben, we struggled to undersatnd the 
                requirments neccessary for our little Arduino board to function as intended, leading to multiple failed attempts to fix all the issues that appeared.
                Luckily for us, our persistence did lead to a solution by the end of the lesson time, giving us hope to build on it for the hackathon next week. 
                Personally, I did my research on the software required to 3D model a gantry, one of the things we are hoping to showcase next week along with 
                our little gadget. After much frustration trying to use AutoCAD, we compomised and will betrying to build a successful example of what the gantry 
                may look like using cardboard.
